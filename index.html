    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Business or B2B Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A business or B2B credit card is issued to a company, organization or sole proprietor rather than to a private individual. The product is structured around business spending: travel, subscriptions, supplier payments and day-to-day expenses.</p>
      <p>The key difference is where liability sits. Some cards make the company liable for all balances, while others use a mixed model where both the company and the cardholder may have obligations. The exact structure is defined in the card agreement.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Business Card Programs Are Structured</h2>
      <p>Business card programs are usually built around an account hierarchy. There is a main company account with a global limit, and then individual cards for employees, teams or departments with their own sub-limits.</p>
      <p>In practice, this can include:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>One master credit line shared across many cards</li>
        <li>Per-card or per-team spending limits</li>
        <li>Category restrictions (for example no cash withdrawals or gambling)</li>
        <li>Centralized billing with monthly statements for the whole company</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some setups settle via direct debit from a business bank account, while others require manual payment of the statement balance each month.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Employee Cards, Controls and Policies</h2>
      <p>Employee cards are typically linked to the same underlying business account, but with their own limits and usage rules. Administrators can often block certain merchant types, set per-transaction caps or restrict usage to specific regions.</p>
      <p>Controls only work as intended when combined with clear internal policies. Companies often define who may hold a card, what can be charged, how receipts are captured and how misuse is handled.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards, Rebates and Supplier Spend</h2>
      <p>Business cards may pay rewards in the form of cash rebates, points, miles or discounts on specific services. Some programs focus on travel, others on general spend or defined categories such as software subscriptions or advertising.</p>
      <p>The business context matters: large supplier payments or recurring invoices may earn rewards differently from small, everyday expenses. Reward economics should always be read alongside fees, interest terms and any separate commercial agreements.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reconciliation, Reporting and Integrations</h2>
      <p>One of the main reasons companies use business cards is to simplify reconciliation. Modern products often include export tools, receipt-capture apps and direct integrations with accounting systems.</p>
      <p>Typical features include cost-centre tagging, project labels and the ability to assign individual transactions to employees or departments. These tools help align the card statement with the company’s internal books, but they still depend on correct configuration and consistent use.</p>
