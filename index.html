    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Business or B2B Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>B2B credit cards are designed for companies, freelancers, contractors and startups — offering higher limits, structured reporting and tools for managing business expenses. They help separate personal and business spending, simplify tax reporting and improve cash flow.</p>
      <p>Unlike personal cards, eligibility is often based on company revenue, business credit history or verification documents. Some cards allow sole proprietors to qualify with personal credit checks.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Expense Controls -->
    <section id="controls" class="section">
      <h2>Expense Controls & Employee Cards</h2>
      <p>Business cards typically allow multiple employee cards with spend limits, category restrictions and real-time notifications. Admins can lock cards instantly, set daily caps or restrict merchant types.</p>
      <p>Many modern issuers integrate directly with accounting software to automate receipt capture, categorize expenses and export transactions into bookkeeping tools.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Benefits & Insurance -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Travel, Insurance & FX Features</h2>
      <p>Business cards often include stronger travel insurance, rental protections, trip delay coverage and purchase protection — especially for frequent work travel.</p>
      <p>International businesses should evaluate FX fees carefully, as some corporate cards charge 2–3%, while others offer reduced or zero FX fees.</p>
